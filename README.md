# Building-a-Data-DashBoard-For-Flight-Delays-and-Cancellations

These data visualizations should be telling a story or highlight patterns in the dataset (the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015)

The dashboard answers mainly 3 questions asked by the client

Q1 Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?
Q2 What causes delays for each airline and state 
Q3 Are any of the delays related to a specific weekday? And are there
any trends throughout the week?

You will find all the details, explanations, designs and dashboard links in the provided pdf
